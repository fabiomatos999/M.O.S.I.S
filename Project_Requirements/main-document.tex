\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Domain Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The system-to-be must allow the backup of the M.O.S.I.S project Raspberry Pi's operating system.
	\item The system-to-be must allow the backup of the images captured by the M.O.S.I.S project Raspberry Pi.
	\item The system-to-be must have a database that stores the media captured by the M.O.S.I.S project Raspberry Pi.
	\item The system-to-be must have a database that stores the sensor captured by the M.O.S.I.S project Raspberry Pi.
	\item The system-to-be must create a stereoscopic image from the media captured by the M.O.S.I.S project Raspberry Pi.
	\item The system-to-be must have the means to pre-configured the type of media capture before and after deployment in the field.
	\item The system-to-be must tag the media captured the M.O.S.I.S Raspberry Pi with the information stored in the database.
	\item The system-to-be must analyze the captured media for bleaching estimates.
	\item The system-to-be must analyze the captured media for area coverage by color.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Interface Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The system-to-be's database must contain image information that includes:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Left Camera Image
		      \item Right Camera Image
		      \item Time Stamp
		      \item Temperature
		      \item Ph
		      \item Pressure
		      \item Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Content
	      \end{itemize}
	\item The system-to-be must have a home page where there is a preview of all images currently within the database.
	\item The system-to-be must create an individual page for each entry within the database.
\end{itemize}
\section{Proposed Solution}
\subsection{Ideas}
\subsubsection{Web Server on Host}
In this implementation, the media captured by the Raspberry pi is transferred to the host machine then a website is generated from the data copied from the Raspberry Pi. The following enumerates the high level steps of this implementation:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The Raspberry Pi captures the data from the camera and the sensors and saves them into a folder (created for that unique entry), that contains the left and right images and the sensor data in the form of a JSON file.
	\item When the host computer wants to view the images, it copies the data onto the host machine.
	\item Then the host machine creates/updates a local database based on the folder structure copied from the Pi analyzing the data on the host machine.
	\item A website is served on the host machine.
\end{enumerate}
