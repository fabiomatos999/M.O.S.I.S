\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Domain Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The system-to-be must allow the backup of the M.O.S.I.S project Raspberry Pi's operating system.
	\item The system-to-be must allow the backup of the images captured by the M.O.S.I.S project Raspberry Pi.
	\item The system-to-be must have a database that stores the media captured by the M.O.S.I.S project Raspberry Pi.
	\item The system-to-be must have a database that stores the sensor captured by the M.O.S.I.S project Raspberry Pi.
	\item The system-to-be must create a stereoscopic image from the media captured by the M.O.S.I.S project Raspberry Pi.
	\item The system-to-be must have the means to pre-configured the type of media capture before and after deployment in the field.
	\item The system-to-be must tag the media captured the M.O.S.I.S Raspberry Pi with the information stored in the database.
	\item The system-to-be must analyze the captured media for bleaching estimates.
	\item The system-to-be must analyze the captured media for area coverage by color.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Interface Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The system-to-be's database must contain image information that includes:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Left Camera Image
		      \item Right Camera Image
		      \item Stereoscopic Image
		      \item Time Stamp
		      \item Temperature
		      \item Ph
		      \item Pressure
		      \item Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Content
	      \end{itemize}
	\item The system-to-be must have a home page where there is a preview of all images currently within the database.
	\item The system-to-be must create an individual page for each entry within the database.
\end{itemize}
