  abstract = {Microscopic-scale processes significantly influence benthic marine ecosystems such as coral reefs and kelp forests. Due to the ocean’s complex and dynamic nature, it is most informative to study these processes in the natural environment yet it is inherently difficult. Here we present a system capable of non-invasively imaging seafloor environments and organisms in situ at nearly micrometre resolution. We overcome the challenges of underwater microscopy through the use of a long working distance microscopic objective, an electrically tunable lens and focused reflectance illumination. The diver-deployed instrument permits studies of both spatial and temporal processes such as the algal colonization and overgrowth of bleaching corals, as well as coral polyp behaviour and interspecific competition. By enabling in situ observations at previously unattainable scales, this instrument can provide important new insights into micro-scale processes in benthic ecosystems that shape observed patterns at much larger scales.},

Learn about the Scrum framework and how teams across several industries typically operate in a Scrum methodology. Transcript below: Transcript: Complex projects can lead to real headaches... Organizing the team… Changes in scope… Roles that aren’t clear.  But you can change that with Scrum, an Agile framework. At its foundation, Scrum can be applied to any project or product development effort. Here’s how it works:  • A product owner creates the product backlog, a prioritized wish list. • During Sprint Planning, the team pulls a chunk from the top of that list and decides how to complete it. • The team has a set timeframe (the sprint) to complete their work.  They meet in a daily scrum to keep the work moving forward. • Along the way, the ScrumMaster keeps the team focused. • At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable. • The team conducts a sprint review on the product and a retrospective on the process. • And then, they choose the next chunk of the backlog and the cycle repeats.  With Scrum, you can ensure the most valuable work has been completed by the time the project ends. Tackle your projects with Scrum.}
