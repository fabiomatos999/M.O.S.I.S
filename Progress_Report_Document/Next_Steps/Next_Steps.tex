\section{Next Steps (Fabio)}
As for what needs to be done next,we will finish the Udemy course on PyQt6 and start implementing the Hardware API. As for speeding up training, we will be culminating the course at ``Section 15: PyQT6.2 released with QtMultimedia \& QtWebEngine Modules'' and skipping sections 9,11,12,13 since they are irrelevant to our project objectives. Since both clients signed the project requirements, we will now be proceeding with the hardware API and database to reach the October 15 deadline.
