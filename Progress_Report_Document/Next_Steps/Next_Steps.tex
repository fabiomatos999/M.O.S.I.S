\section{Next Steps (Fabio)}
As for what needs to be done next, before the progress report presentation is due, we will finish the Udemy course on PyQt6, design the database schema for the M.O.S.I.S UI and create a mock-up for the UI. As for speeding up training, we will be culminating the course at ``Section 15: PyQT6.2 released with QtMultimedia & QtWebEngine Modules'' and skipping sections 9,11,12,13 since that are irrelevant to our project objectives. After the mock-up is approved by the client, the front-end milestone can be implemented and completed by October fifteenth.
