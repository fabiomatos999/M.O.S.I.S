\end{itemize}
Back End (Eduardo):
\begin{itemize}
	\item Store shot id , shot type, ISO, shutter speed, white balance and white balance in one table
	\item Store media id, shot id, left media path, right media path, ISO 8601 date stamp, illumination type, temperature, dissolved oxygen, Ph and pressure in one table
	\item Relate shot id to all media with that specific shot id
	\item Select all table related to a study using shot id
\end{itemize}
Hardware API (Fabio):
\begin{itemize}
	\item Document existing, transferable camera library functions
	\item Adapt camera functions to utilize database and folder structure schema
	\item Receive sensor data from UART port with a baud rate of 115200, 8 data bits and 1 stop bit
	\item Split sensor data string at the ampersand character
	\item Create a JSON file from the data and metadata
\end{itemize}
Folder Structure Generator (Eduardo):
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create folder based Id, shot type, ISO 8601 date stamp and illumination type
	\item Store all media files within the created folder
	\item Store JSON file with all data and metadata associated with the study in the same folder as the media files
	\item Identify media entry using shot id, ISO 8601 date stamp, illumination, ISO, shutter speed, aperture size and white balance
\end{itemize}
