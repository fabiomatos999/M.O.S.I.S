\subsection{Software Interfaces}
M.O.S.I.S UI 2.0 has a total of three communication interfaces between the various peripherals:
\begin{enumerate}
\item UART Port
\item Camera SDK
\item UNIX File system
\end{enumerate}
The UART port is used to communicate with the sensor hub. The sensor hub provides methods to calibrate both pH and dissolved oxygen sensors and receive temperature, pH, pressure and dissolved oxygen data, in the form of a string, from the sensor hub sensors (See \ref{s:other_documentation} for detailed information on the sensor hub). The UART port on the sensor hub is configured with a baud rate of 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit and no parity bit on the port ``/dev/ttyAMA0'' on GPIO pins 14 and 15.\cite{UARTRaspberryPi} The camera SDK is the proprietary vendor software development kit by Pixelink used to communicate with both of the on board cameras.\cite{WhatFunctionsFeatures}. Finally, the UNIX file system is used to save, move, rename, read, write and delete the media files generated by the camera as well storing the SQLite database for the UI. The UNIX file system can be interacted directly by system calls, by shell abstractions such as cp, cd and mv or by the ``os'' or ``shutil'' packages in Python.\cite{SystemCallsUnix}\cite{UnixShellSummary}\cite{OsMiscellaneousOperating}\cite{ShutilHighlevelFile}
