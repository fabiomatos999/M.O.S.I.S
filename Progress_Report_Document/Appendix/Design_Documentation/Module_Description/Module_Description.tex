\subsection{Module Description (Fabio)}
M.O.S.I.S UI 2.0 is comprised of four fundamental modules:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Front End
	\item Back end (database)
	\item Hardware API
	\item Folder structure generator
\end{enumerate}
The front end consists of the user all facing elements, e.i everything that is in the UI mock-ups without signals or the database interaction layers needed to make it functional. The back end (or database) consists of software components and functions to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create the database.
	\item Select existing media entries and their associated metadata.
	\item Insert new media entries and metadata to the database
\end{itemize}
The hardware API is the set of software functions that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sends commands to the cameras and receives files and preview streams from them.
	\item Send command to the sensor hub to: calibrate the pH and dissolved oxygen sensors and receive the readings from the sensors in the form of a string.
\end{itemize}
Finally, the folder structure generator interacts with the database, file system and the cameras to write the media files to a folder browsable folder structure along with a exporting a JSON file with all the data from the database for a media entry.
