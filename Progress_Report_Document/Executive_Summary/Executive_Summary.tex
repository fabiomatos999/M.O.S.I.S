\section*{Executive Summary (Fabio)}
The current U.I for the M.O.S.I.S microscope is unsuitable for on site research, it does not use the on board buttons, crashed frequently and lacks design cohesion. The objectives for our project has not changed, we will deliver an user interface that will allow the users of studying the underwater lifeforms on site. The requirements has not changed but the client added some new requirements, such as a formal time stamp and being able to configure the cameras at site with the U.I. Up to now we've been on pace finishing the udemy PyQt6  class and the design schema for the database. Due to the microscope not being available from October 15 to October 21 are being moved around to conform to the delay. Both the back end API and hardware API are being moved up to October 15, while the front end is being moved to October 30.  The expenditure according to the budget is on track. The only difference was the equipment cost since the M.O.S.I.S microscope and the laptops were bought beforehand they are not included in the new budget. The difference in budget is \$41,703.03 - \$29,804.22 = \$11,900.81. The remaining tasks left in the project is the back end API for October 15, the hardware API for October 15, the front end for October 30, the folder structure generator for November 7 and integrating front end with back end for November 13.
