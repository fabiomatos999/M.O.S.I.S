\section{Introduction (Fabio)}
The Marine Operated Stereoscopic Imaging System (M.O.S.I.S) is an underwater microscope created by David M. Repollet Otero along side his principal investigator Manuel A. Jimenez Cedeno. This microscope captures stereoscopic media of its subject and records environmental conditions such as temperature, pH, pressure and dissolved oxygen. This device will help marine biologist researchers on studying how climate change is affecting aquatic ecosystems. The M.O.S.I.S microscope already has a user interface previously made for the device, but it lacks design cohesion, is slow, crashes constantly, lacks most of the required features and cannot be operated using the on board buttons. This is why for our capstone project we have decided to create a new user interface that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can be utilized under water using the on board buttons.
	\item Can capture media en five different shot types: single, burst, time lapse, telescopic and video.
	\item Control gain, saturation, shutter speed and white balance for both of the cameras.
	\item Can calibrate both pH and dissolved oxygen sensors.
	\item Record environmental conditions along side of the captured media.
	\item Utilize either White, Red or Ultraviolet light to capture images.
\end{itemize}
Some of these objectives have changed slightly since the proposal due to newly found limitations to the cameras or a misunderstanding of the existing hardware.\\
