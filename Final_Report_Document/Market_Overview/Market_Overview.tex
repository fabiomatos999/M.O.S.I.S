\section{Market Overview (Eduardo)}
The current users for this project are the marine biology researchers. Since the device has a purpose built user interface for a embedded system research project, there is no potential market right now for this project. When the M.O.S.I.S microscope project is finished it would be used as a research device by some universities, so the potential market would be small. There is only one similar device made by Andrew Mullen at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography - University of California San Diego, named Benthic Underwater Microscope (BUM). The difference between BUM and MOSIS is that MOSIS microscope has sensors which allows the researchers to analyze the water's temperature, dissolved oxygen, pressure and pH.
