\section{Market Overview (Eduardo)}
The current users for this project are the marine biology researchers. Since the device is a purpose built user interface for a embedded system research project, there is no potential market right now for this project. When the project is finish it would be used a research device by some universitaries, so the potential market would be small. There is only one similar device made by Andrew Mullen at Scripps Institution of Oceanography - University of California San Diego, named Benthic Underwater Microscope (BUM). The difference between BUM and MOSIS is that MOSIS microscope has sensors which allows the researchers to analyze the water's temperature, dissolved oxygen, pressure and pH.
