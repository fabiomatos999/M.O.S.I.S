\section{Results and impact of the project (Eduardo)}
M.O.S.I.S completed the project in the time frame indicated. The technical results of the project is allowing the microscope to be controlled with the on board holo effect sensors. The user interface also permits the user to control the LEDs on the microscope and configure the cameras as per the studies. In the ethical aspects of the project the values of the the project were efficiency, open source software and the environment. The project is open source and does not require any confidentiality. With the environmental aspects of the project the risks are affecting the corals and other marine species. We have taken precautions with the lights only turning them on during studies and for timelapse turning the light on and off during the study. For the social aspects of the project it will allow the researchers to get better data on the bleaching on the corals and will let them publish the results with other researchers.
