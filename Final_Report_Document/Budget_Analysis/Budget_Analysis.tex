\section{Budget Analysis (Eduardo)}
Fixing the error in the actual cost calculation the total cost of the project was: \$41,703.03 with the overhead cost, \$19,870.59 without overhead cost. The error was calculating the overhead with the new equipment cost not including the M.O.S.I.S microscope since it was already built and the laptops since they were already bought.
