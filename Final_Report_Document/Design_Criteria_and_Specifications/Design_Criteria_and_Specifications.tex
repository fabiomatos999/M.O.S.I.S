\section{Design Critera and Specifications (Eduardo)}
We chose PyQt6 for the front end since the official language supported by the Raspberry Pi is python and PyQt6 is python wrapper of the Qt library. Which allowed us to display our user interface and allowed for integration with the on boards buttons and LEDS. For the database we chose SQlite for the backend since it is a single threaded database that can be backed up locally in a file system. Those decisions were based on reducing power consumption for the microscope since it was going to be in on site and the client wanted to maximize battery life and be open sourced. The software architecture for this project contains 5 main modules: the user interface module, cameras module, solid state drive, sensor hub and SQlite database. The user interface contains the camera control module, sensor calibration module, study select menu and preview screen. This connects to the Cameras using the Camera SDK, the SQlite database and solid state drive using the file system, and the sensor hub using the UART port. Originally we were using ISO and aperture size to configure the camera but the camera's SDK did not support it. We had to change those specifcations to saturation and gain. The SDK also did not support sending an embedded thread on linux, to work around it we captured a photo, processed it and used that as the preview image on the preview screen. That affected our system specifcations since the frame rate on the cameras suffered and had to be lowered from 15 to 1/3 frame per seconds. The recommended requirements of the software to run properly is the working preview screen, the capturing of the image with sensor data and the database storing and backing up the data.
