\section{Outcomes (Eduardo)}
We at M.O.S.I.S will redesign and deliver a presentable Graphical User Interface that will allow the user to be able to use the M.O.S.I.S project Raspberry Pi to analyze the data captured. To do so, the system will be made with Python API and Tknter to make the User Interface that is stable and can do simple command as needed by the user. 
With it the researcher can use M.O.S.I.S to study using the various sensors available. The data gathered will be then stored in a Raspberry Pi hard drive and will be backed up into a local database to be analyzed. After which the researcher can access and view accordingly to what's needed.
