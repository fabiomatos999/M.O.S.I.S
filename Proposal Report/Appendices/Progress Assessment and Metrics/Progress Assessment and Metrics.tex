 \section{Progress Assessment \& Metrics (Eduardo)}
To keep track of progress we will be using the Scrum methodology. Each sprint we will choose certain tasks to complete and receive feedback from our client. At the end of the sprint we will evaluate and see if we met our goals or missed the deadline. Some of the metrics we will use are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tasks Completed
    \item Performance Speed
    \item Problems that surged during sprint
    \item Client Feedback
    \item Future Tasks
\end{itemize}
To choose the tasks we will be checking in with the client and referring to our Gantt Charts. This will allow us to keep track of our progress and see if we are meeting our deadlines.
