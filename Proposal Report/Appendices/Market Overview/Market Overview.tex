\section{Market Overview (Fabio)}
Since this is a purpose built user interface for a embedded system research project, there is no potential market for this project. There is one research project for underwater microscopy from Andrew D. et. all.\cite{mullenUnderwaterMicroscopySitu2016} But the potential market for the M.O.S.I.S microscope and its accompanying software could be modestly big. It would mainly be used as a research device for universities, thus the total market size would be small. However, since it is a complete research tool for marine researchers, it could potentially be popular within that specific segment of the population.
