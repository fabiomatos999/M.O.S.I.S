\section{Market Overview (Fabio)}
Since this is a purpose built user interface for a embedded system research project, there is no potential market for this project. But the potential market for the M.O.S.I.S microscope and its accompanying software could be modestly big. It would mainly be used as a research device for universities, thus the total market size would be small. However, since it is a complete research tool for marine researchers, it could potentially be popular within that specific segment of the population.
