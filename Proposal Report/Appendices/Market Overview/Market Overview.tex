\section{Market Overview (Fabio)}
Since this is a purpose built user interface for a embedded system research project, there is not potential market for this device. But the potential market for the M.O.S.I.S microscope and it's accompanying software could be modestly big. It would mainly be used as a research device for universities, thus the total market size would be small. However, since it is a complete device suite for marine researchers, it could potentially be popular within that specific segment of the population.
