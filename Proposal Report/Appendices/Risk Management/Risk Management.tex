     One or more of the camera feeds fail&0.20&Add diagnostic information to startup and log error to console and log file.\\ \hline
     The Tiva microcontroller UART fails&0.05&Prevent U.I startup if failure is detected and log error to console and log file.\\ \hline
     The microscope casing is leaking&0.40&Detect the leak using the onboard sensor, log to a log file and initiate a graceful shutdown. \\ \hline
     The database becomes corrupted.&0.01&Reconstruct database from folder structure.\\ \hline
     The screen malfunctions&0.05&Unrecoverable\\ \hline
     The on board buttons fail&0.1&In the field it is unrecoverable but can be operated via a wireless mouse on land.\\ \hline
     The RTOS becomes corrupted&0.01&The data is stored in a waterproof and shockproof solid state disk, thus the data is unaffected and the microscope will be periodically backed up via the Host Software.\\ \hline
