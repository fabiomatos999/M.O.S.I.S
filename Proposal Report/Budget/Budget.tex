 \section{Budget (Eduardo)}
 The budget for the M.O.S.I.S project is divided into 3 major categories, those being Human Resources, Equipment and Facility. Human Resources includes the labor costs of a average entry level software engineer in Puerto Rico\cite{SoftwareEngineerSalary}. Equipment are those costs that include the software programs and hardware components required for the development of the project. The facility costs are related to the location in where the development of the project will occur. The overhead cost is 50\% of the total of the human resources, equipment and facility cost. The following table includes the summary of costs:
