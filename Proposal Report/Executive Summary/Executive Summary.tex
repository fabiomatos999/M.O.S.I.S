 \section*{Executive Summary}
 The existing user interface on the M.O.S.I.S microscope is currently unsuited for the use of the on board buttons and is unwieldy and unreliable for use in the field. This is further compounded by the fact that since the M.O.S.I.S project is aimed at marine researchers and biologists, having such an unpolished user interface is unacceptable. David M. Repollet Otero and Dr. Manuel Jim√©nez are the major stakeholders in this remake and they are expecting a user interface for the M.O.S.I.S microscope that is easy to use in the field while still providing the basic functionality of the microscope such as capturing media, switching the type of study being performed and the safe shutdown of the system. By the end of the semester it expected that a user interface, database and a standardized folder structure for the captured media be delivered that will comprise a whole product known as M.O.S.I.S U.I  2.0. The key milestones for this project are the front end of the user interface, the database API for the local database, the automated construction of the folder structure from the database and lastly the integration between the front end and back end. \textbf{ADD ECONOMIC ASPECTS HERE}
