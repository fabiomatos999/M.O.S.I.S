%%Que vas hacer, como lo vas a medir y para cuando SER ESPECIFICO
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design an UI for the M.O.S.I.S project Raspberry Pi by November 27, 2023 to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item control the functions of the microscope, utilizes the onboard buttons, shows a live preview at 15 fps at a downscale resolution of 1920 X 1080
        \item display temperature sensors with an accuracy of 3 significant digits
        \item display Ph sensors with an accuracy of 2 significant digits
        \item display pressure sensor with an accuracy of n significant digits.
        \item display dissolved oxygen sensor data with an accuracy of 2 significant digits
        \item choose the configuration file for the specific study to be done
        \item achieving a tenfold increase in responsiveness in comparison to the existing user interface when switching through different windows in the user interface
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Adapt the currently existing hardware API, by November 27, 2023 to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Display the live feed from the cameras to the U.I 
        \item Parse the temperature, Ph, pressure and dissolved oxygen data string from the UART port
        \item run diagnostic sub-routines at application start
    \end{itemize}
    \item Store data and metadata that include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item left camera media
        \item right camera media
        \item shot type
        \item time stamp
        \item temperature
        \item Ph
        \item pressure
        \item dissolved oxygen
    \end{itemize}
    in a format that a researcher can browse in a file browser, by November 27, 2023.
